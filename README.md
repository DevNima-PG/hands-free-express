# hands-free-express
-THE ULTIMATE TOOL OF BUILDING FAST-

## What was the problem?
Ah! Shit. A new project, making the folder structure, writing the same base code as other projects, copying and pasting all of them, initializing git, downloading packages, initializing package.json, running server and ... <strong> WTF BRO!? </strong>

## So How Was This Solved? ðŸ¤”
Aaaa~ A good one. Well, Actually one night when I was just chatting as normal with one of my developer friends the idea came out of the cave  and then I started to write it.
- Creates Folder Structures (For both app directory and class-based(OOP) projects and functional projects (no-app)) âœ…
- Creates Some Basic and Obvious files of those directories âœ…
- Initializes package.json âœ¨âœ…
- Installs the basic common packages (express, mongoose, morgan, cors, http-erros, http-status-codes, jsonwebtoken, dotenv and a bunch of others) ðŸŽ‰âœ¨ 
- Writes the basic server code needed for both OOP and functional projects. (The require statements don't need changes ) âœ¨âœ… 
- Creates a Special response-builder names (SendResponse) âœ¨âœ¨ 
- Creates some very useful middlewares such as validation Error mapper and ... âœ…
- With also more utils such as a key generator for generating Secret_key for JWT tokens. âœ…
- .gitignore and git out of the box, with node_modules and .env ignored ðŸŽ‰âœ¨âœ… 
- Adds dev command to package.json file and runs the server for you (in functional or no-app mode)
- What Else you want! Open an issue and let's talk!
